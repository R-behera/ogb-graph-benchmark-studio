# Supply Network Disruption Benchmark

![Demo Screenshot](demo/screenshot.png)

## Overview

Benchmark graph models on supplier, route, and dependency networks to predict disruption spillover across the supply chain.

## Real-world problem

- User: Supply chain analytics and resilience teams
- Problem: Disruptions spread through supplier networks in ways tabular scorecards miss.
- Decision improved: Prioritize alternate suppliers and contingency plans before disruption spills over.
- KPI target: Reduce disruption downtime and improve supplier resilience planning.

## Why this matters

This repo is positioned as a real product for a real team, not a framework-only demo. The goal is to show how research-backed AI, analytics, or graph systems become deployable workflows with docs, UI, screenshots, and business-facing outputs.

## Project profile

- Domain: Supply Chain Risk Analytics
- Project type: `ml`
- Tags: supply-chain, graph, benchmark, risk

## Workflow

1. Ingest the operational context for the user and case.
2. Score risk, quality, or opportunity using the project API.
3. Compare current signals against a business baseline.
4. Generate a recommendation or operator brief for the next step.

## Quick start

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
